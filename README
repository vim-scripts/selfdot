Typing "self." can be annoying, mistyping -- even more.  This plugin
lets you save keystrokes by expanding "." into "self." in places where
putting a dot is a syntax error, e.g. at the beginning of an indented
line or right after an operator.

Confusing version numbers: calling the first release v1.0 was
a mistake, so I renamed v1.0.3 to v0.1.3
